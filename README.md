# Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion

Introduction
This tutorial shows how to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model on a custom dataset of {image, caption} pairs. We build on top of the fine-tuning script provided by Hugging Face.

We assume that you have a high-level understanding of the Stable Diffusion model. The following resources can be helpful if you're looking for more information in that regard:

- High-performance image generation using Stable Diffusion in KerasCV
- Stable Diffusion with Diffusers

It's highly recommended that you use a GPU with at least 30GB of memory to execute the code.
